# Flashing with new firmware

When new images are released, we will provide a link to them. To flash NavQ+, you will have two options. You can either flash the eMMC chip on-board, or flash the SD card included with the kit. The eMMC is faster, but is not removable like the SD card. It is up to you to choose which one to use.

The command to flash the board will be provided once a new build has been created. We will update this page swiftly once we have it.
